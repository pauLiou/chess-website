<h1> Chess Computer Vision Website </h1>

I have developed a web app using Flask that can classify chess pieces.

- Flask Web App: ```website folder```
- Chess Classification backend: ```model folder```

<h1> Who is it for? </h1>

- Chess enthusiasts who are interested in seeing their game translated into a FEN code that they could then use engine analysis on
- Anyone interested in deep learning models

<h1> Technologies used </h1>

- HTML & CSS
- Python
- Flask
- Bootstrap
- SQLite and SQLAlchemy
- OpenCV
- Werkzeug
- WTForms

<h1> Main Functionality </h1>

- User authentication
- Database management
- Add & remove content for user
- FEN code and SVG saved on account
- JPG/PNG upload storage

Here is a snap shot of the SVG output from an uploaded chess board:

<img src="/current_board.svg" width="500" height="500">

And here is the current design for the login screen template:

<img src="/login.jpg" width="500" height="250">

<h1> Installation </h1>

```git clone https://github.com/pauliou/chess-website.git```

Currently the application will not run without the machine learning weights applied. For access to this, please contact me.
